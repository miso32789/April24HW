In this challange I was able to make sure that upon first prompt 
if there is no numeric value picked thwn an alert will pop up tp make sure that one is selcted and it will not continue to the next propmt.

I was able to ensure that the code is capturing a something (the information to be stored) once the prompt is answered in order to generate a passowrd at the end

I was about to makke sure that alerts are set up for any discrepancies with the code selected to allow for the user to get what password they desire

In conclusion based on selected factors, the passowrd generates to the satisfaction of the criteria picked and is secure

Toodles!
